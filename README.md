# André Pinheiro

Hello! I'm André Pinheiro, currently doing 2nd year of B.Sc., Computer Science at University of Minho.

Besides my studies at university, I am currently looking at improving my problem-solving skills by grinding competitive programming and mathematical olympiads, which are the subjects I most like. 
My long-term goals are to enjoy a research career and of course having fun solving problems :)
