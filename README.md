## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm AndrÃ© Pinheiro, currently doing 3rd year of B.Sc., Computer Science at University of Minho.

## About Me

I'm a 21-year-old and I am currently looking at improving my problem-solving skills by grinding competitive programming and mathematical olympiads, which are the subjects I most like. My long-term goals are to enjoy a research career and of course having fun solving problems :)
